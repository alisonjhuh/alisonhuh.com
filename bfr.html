          to help redesign their Wordpress site. I took on the primary tasks of
          modernizing their overall aesthetic, streamlining the website's navigation,
          and helping promote their newly revived online blog.

            The Berkeley Fiction Review is a UC Berkeley undergraduate, student-run publication.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Founded in 1981, the Berkeley Fiction Review is UC Berkeleyâ€™s oldest
            prose journal, having emerged as a descendant of Berkeley's <i>Occident</i>
            literary journal (1881 - 1960). BFR welcomes innovative short fiction,
            as well as traditionally constructed stories to be submitted for their
            annually printed journal.
            <br><br>
            As a web designer, I led the ideation, prototyping, and implementation
            for their updated Wordpress website. I worked closely with the
            managing editors at the time to get their continuous feedback as users
            as I planned out each page.

        <div class="proj-content">
          <h4 class="callout">
            The design of BFR's old website made it difficult to navigate and
            order past issues, while also providing an obstacle for the team in
            reviving their online blog presence.
          </h4>
          <p>
            In my initial conversations with the BFR managing editors, they brought up
            5 main goals they wanted to focus on with this website redesign:<p>
              <p>(1) An overall redesign in aesthetics</p>
              <p>(2) A cleaner, intuitive navigation</p>
              <p>(3) More professional layout for blogposts</p>
              <p>(4) Easier navigation of past/archived issues</p>
              <p>(5) A "heavy overhaul in dragging [BFR] to the 21st century"</p>

            Discovering other literary magazines to see how they
            juggle their own online marketplace, blogs, and print publications.
          </h4>
          <p>
          To get a better grasp of the BFR team's vision, I went back-and-forth with
          several of the publication's editors to understand what website improvements
          they wanted to prioritize as well as the aesthetic direction they wanted to take.
          <br><br>
          The team first sent me a color palette that they had in mind, along with
          four sources of inspiration from other literary publications.
          </p>
          <img class="body-img" src="images/bfr-inspo.jpg" alt="Inspiration and color palette for the BFR website">
          <p>
            <br>
            Immediately, some patterns I noticed across the team's requests and
            inspiration were: (1) A simplified navigation bar at the top of the page,
            (2) a large splash page that featured a publication or story of choice,
            and (3) a user experience that would direct traffic through home page content
            rather than depending solely on the navigation bar.
            <br><br>
            Keeping in mind the overarching goal of simplifying the
            process of updating the website as well, I wanted to make sure that
            the team would need to do little to no maintenance work in addition to their
            regular posting of announcements, blogs, or other online content.

            Simplifying the Berkeley Fiction Review website while creating an
            active online presence.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Something I constantly had to keep in mind throughout the redesign
            process was figuring out how to add and highlight new blog content without
            overshadowing their large amounts of existing online content.
            Below is the original home page for reference.
          </p>
          <img class="body-img" src="images/og-bfr.jpg" alt="The original BFR home page">
          <p>
            Naturally, the first thing that came to mind was reorganizing the
            menu bar â€” having to remove and restructure some pages â€” to simplify
            the overall navigation experience for users. We changed several menu items,
            some of them previously having over 30 sub-items, into their own standalone pages or
            opted to merge them with similar entries, like we did with our About and DeCal pages.
            <br><br>
            However, all this helped narrow down our long-spanning navigation menu into six
            categories that were visually sorted by relative importance. The homepage
            and submissions at the edges to catch the most attention, and the past issues
            gallery ("Journal") at the center to engage users with order forms and views.
            <br><br>
            On top of the navigation revamp, we made the newest issue the highlight of the
            landing plage in order to encourage more orders and interest in the print
            publication. With our newest major announcements on the landing page,
            we felt it would help BFR's online presence appear more
            active, showing continuously updated content at the front of their page.
            Below, you can check out the first two page mockups I created and presented to
            the team early in our prototyping process.
