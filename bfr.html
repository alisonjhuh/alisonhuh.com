          to help redesign their Wordpress site. I took on the task of

          and helping promote their newly revived online blog.

            The Berkeley Fiction Review is a UC Berkeley undergraduate, student-run publication.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Founded in 1981, the Berkeley Fiction Review is UC Berkeleyâ€™s oldest
            prose journal, having emerged as a descendant of Berkeley's <i>Occident</i>
            literary journal (1881 - 1960).
            <br><br>
            As a designer, I led the ideation, prototyping, and implementation
            for their updated Wordpress website. I worked closely with the
            managing editors at the time to quickly garner feedback and iterate from 
            their comments.

            BFR's old website design made it difficult to navigate and order past issues,
            while also providing an obstacle for the team in reviving their online blog 
            presence.
          </h4>
          <p>
            In my initial conversations with the managing editors, we established 5 objectives 
            to focus on with this website redesign:<p>
              <p>(1) An overall redesign in aesthetics</p>
              <p>(2) A cleaner, intuitive navigation</p>
              <p>(3) More professional layout for blogposts</p>
              <p>(4) Easier navigation of past/archived issues</p>
              <p>(5) A "heavy overhaul in dragging [BFR] to the 21st century"</p>

            I explored other literary magazines to see how they juggle their 
            own online marketplace, blogs, and print publications.

          <p>
            <br>
            The BFR team sent over inspiration from other literary publications to point out 
            functionalities, interfaces, and interactions that they wanted to see reflected 
            in their updated side. Some major aspects I noticed across the team's requests and
            inspiration were: (1) A simplified navigation bar at the top of the page,
            (2) a large splash page that highlighted a publication or story of choice,
            and (3) a flow that would direct traffic through home page content
            rather than depending solely on the navigation bar.
            <br><br>
            In addition to simplifying the process of updating the website, I 
            wanted to make sure that the team would need to do little to no 
            maintenance work on top of their regular posting activity.

            Simplifying the Berkeley Fiction Review website while creating an
            active online presence.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Something I constantly kept in mind throughout the redesign
            process was how to add and highlight new blog content without
            overshadowing their large amount of existing online content.
            <br><br> 
            The old site had over 40 total navigation items embedded within 
            their menu, and the existing front-page content acted more as an 
            "About" page. It didn't give users According to the team, this resulted in users often 
            bouncing from the site.
            <br><br> 
            Below are snippets from the original home page for reference:
          </p>
          <img class="body-img" src="images/og-bfr.jpg" alt="The original BFR home page">
          <p>
            We first tackled the menu bar, which included an information architecture 
            overhaul to simplify the navigation for users. In addition to the navigation 
            revamp, we decided to highlight the newest issue at the front of the
            landing plage in order garner interest in the print publication and provide 
            users with an action. With our newest major announcements on the landing page,
            we felt it would help BFR's online presence appear more active, with continuously 
            updated content at the front of their page.
            <br><br>
            Below, you can check out the two-page mockup I created and presented to
            the team midway through our prototyping process:

            A small hiccup we experienced along the way and how we overcame it.
          </h4>
          <p>
            As I finished the first bits of my mockup, I wanted to get started on 
            implementation to work with our set timeline. This was when we realized
            that we were pretty limited in what we <i>could</i> actually implement 
            on the site since it was hosted on the free version of Wordpress. 
            <br><br> 
            It wasn't my place to mandate that the team subscribes to a paid tier 
            for the sake of adding every part of my design, so we chose to trade off 
            certain aesthetic elements of the interface to prioritize the user 
            experience and work within the bounds of the tools we had. 
            <br><br>
            At the end of the project, I feel we were able to still embody 
            the overall vision of the new site!

            Design work involves a whole lot more than just designing.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Given this was my first time working in a major design project, I appreciated 
            the amount of trust that the BFR team put in not only my vision but also my 
            skills. I was familiar with how to use Figma for my personal use before, but 
            I had never had to think as deeply about the user experience, from both the 
            readers' and publishers' perspective, while creating my mockups. I found myself 
            having to juggle 
            questions such as:<br><br>
            
              âœ… Where do we want to direct our users to <i>most</i> for our landing page call to action? <br>
              âœ… What content belongs in a footer menu as opposed to top-level navigation? <br>
              âœ… How can we par down the amount of information on each page?<br>
            <br>
            While there definitely are design choice I would have made differently in hindsight, 
            I'm super grateful that I had this opportunity to not only gain experience in designing a 
            new internface but also to help bring greater online visibility 
            to the work that the Berkeley Fiction Review creates.
            <br><br>
            Special thanks to Regina Lim, Molly Nolan, and Alex Luceli Jimneez for working
