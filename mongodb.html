        <p> During the summer of 2021, I joined the Server Docs team at MongoDB's NYC office as a
          technical writer intern. My team's work primarily revolved around documenting new and updated
          features on MongoDB's open-source server, geared towards developer audiences. In addition to
          my day-to-day work, I also jumped into two additional side projects that gave me the opportunity
          to collaborate with teams outside of just the Docs team.

            I learned that "going out of my comfort zone" didn't just refer to my technical skills.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Given this was my first time ever writing technical documentation for
            a developer audience in a corporate setting, the early portion of my
            internship involved navigating the ins-and-outs of the product,
            asking for guidance when needed, and keeping my mind open in trying to
            find a lesson in everything I did.
            <br><br>
            With this, the first half of my internship largely revolved around ticket-based work.
            I was onboarded onto the team with my mentor teaching me everything
            I needed to know: Git, Github, Markdown, JIRA, and the rest of our
            "Docs-As-Code" workflow. I started with small tickets â€” typo fixes â€”
            that accustomed me to the team's review process. As I got more comfortable
            with the work and MongoDB's server, my responsibilities evolved into
            longer features and new v5.0 updates.
            <br><br>
            Through this rapid ramp-up of work, I quickly learned that technical writing involves much more than just <i>writing</i>.
            The role came with the additional responsibility of acting as a sort of
            beta tester for the engineering teams â€” testing out new features to properly document its behavior.
            On top of that, all of my written work ultimately boiled down to how we could break down
            a complex, technical topic in the simplest way for our end user to understand. In that way, I felt we writers
            played a unique role, acting simultaneously as an educator and advocate for our developer audiences, while
            juggling our various internal stakeholders as well.

        <div class="proj-content">
          <h4 class="callout">
            I realized that this was the best opportunity for me to just experiment â€” working with
            different teams and seeing what else I can do with my skillset.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Since I'm only 21-years old, I only have the slightest idea of what I'd actually
            want to do with my long-term career. Understanding this, one of my team members, Naomi,
            offered to have me jump into two tech-writing-adjacent projects that would help
            me explore different types of writing within the company during my internship!
            <br><br>
            In the first project, I got to work as a sort of technical consultant for MongoDB's architecture diagrams
            redesign, making sure key server concepts were accurately represented. Here, I got to participate in the design iteration
            process, mainly trying to solve questions like: Would something that visually makes sense on its own
            confuse users when integrated into a larger diagram? This project helped me
            find some initial footing in understanding user experiences and design from an
            educational, rather than product, standpoint.
            <br><br>
            For my second project, I was involved directly with writing, helping my team
            write, edit, and reveiw new copy for our Server Docs landing page. With this project,
            I directly collaborated with Naomi in writing the web copy â€” taking part in back-and-forth
            reviews of each other's work. What differentiated this from my day-to-day tech writing
            was the way that I got to work with PMMs in balancing the educational responsibilities of
            the Docs with the necessity for certain marketing placements. Especially because I came
            from previous experience in marketing, I appreciated this new opportunity to work with
            the two disciplines side-by-side â€” figuring out what aspects of one career I may have preferred over the other.

            I gained confidence as a writer, as I learned to navigate
            the product and communicate such complex, technical topics to broad audiences.
          </h4>
          <p>
            This internship was a really refreshing experience largely due to the way
            the Docs team let me hop into the team's everyday workflow, rather than keeping me restrained with
            a siloed intern project. With the help of my mentor, Andrew, I felt so well equipped to be able to
            just dive into my work with confidence, which in turn helped me discover my own value as a writer.
            <br><br>
            In the past, especially with my academic English literature classes, I'd continuously pour over small
            details about my writing style. But with technical writing focusing on accuracy and brevity, I feel I
            was largely able to break many of my habits of overthinking what my writing communicated. Now, as I
            continue school with this experience up my belt, I've become much more confident in being able to
            express my ideas and walk readers through my thought processes, without the need for extra, stylistic
            flourish.

          <p>
            Andrew Feierabend â€” Thank you for your patience and constant positive
            affirmation in teaching me everything I know about technical writing
            and more. I owe so much of my personal growth this summer to you for
            your mentorship.
            <br><br>
            Naomi Pentrel â€” I really appreciate how you were able to pull me into
            different projects outside of the typical docs workflow, introducing
            me to new people across the organization. I discovered so much about
            my own interests within writing, thanks to your active involvement
            in my intern experience.
            <br><br>
            Natalie Chwalk â€” I <i>literally</i> would not be here without you!
            From dispelling my fears about my first ever technical interview to
            always being available to answer my questions throughout the internship,
            I'm so grateful for all the help you've provided along the way.
            <br><br>
            The Server Docs Team â€” Without all your support, I would not have thrived
            as much as I did this summer. Thank you for the seamless
            onboarding experience, for teaching me about so much beyond just tech
            writing, and for all your investment in my success.
            <br><br>
            And everyone else that I had the pleasure of working with this summer! :)
